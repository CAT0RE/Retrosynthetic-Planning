# Retrosynthetic-Planning
Retrosynthetic planning is a crucial aspect of organic chemistry that involves identifying a series of chemical reactions required to synthesize a target product. The processinvolves breaking down the target molecule into smaller, simpler compounds, which can be further deconstructed until a set of available starting materials is obtained. This strategic approach has become an essential tool in the field of organic chemistry, as it enables chemists to synthesize complex compounds efficiently and with greater control.

However, the vast number of possible chemical transformations makes the search space for retrosynthetic planning very large, and it can be challenging even for experienced chemists. To address this issue, researchers have developed computational methods that aid in the identification of feasible retrosynthetic pathways.

In this project,the retrosynthetic planning process can be divided into three main steps. The first step involves the prediction of single-step retrosynthesis, where the target molecule is broken down into smaller, simpler compounds. The second step involves evaluating the feasibility of each of these compounds, taking into account their availability and cost. The final step is multi-step retrosynthesis planning, where a series of reactions are identified that can be used to synthesize the target compound from the available starting materials.
